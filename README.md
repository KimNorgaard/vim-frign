# About
frign is a 24-bit vim color scheme inspired by [frign's screenshot over at suckless.org](https://st.suckless.org/screenshots/frign-2016.png) and the [nofrils color scheme](https://github.com/robertmeta/nofrils).

It is designed around the base color `#114488` and is ment to be a minimalist,
almost monochromatic color scheme. There is very little syntax highligting.
Apart from the dominant blues it is designed to keep itself out of your way.

It does support 8-bit colors as well but it looks terrible and is not
recommended.
